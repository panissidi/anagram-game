# Anagram game


Requirements:
* The user is presented with 6 letters that make at least one valid six-letter word
* The user can enter 3-6 letter words that can be made from those letters
* The game should only allow valid words, no proper nouns
* The game should show which words the user has already gotten
* The user should be able to indicate that they are done, at which point
  * The user should be given a new set of characters

Potential extensions:
* Add a timer
* Have a way for the user to visually scramble the letters
* Show all the words the user missed when they indicate they are done
* Show how many remaining words there are of each length
* Implement a scoring system (you lose if you donâ€™t get any of the 6 letter words)
